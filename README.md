**STUDENT-RESULT-ANALYSIS-DATABASE**

Student Result Analysis System is a web-based application developed for colleges to analyze examination results and keep 
track of studentsâ€™ academic performance. The system allows viewing individual student results as well as department-wise result analysis
without heavy manual work. It is designed to simplify the marks analysis process in educational institutions, especially with the growing number
of students where manual computation is not practical.

The application not only computes results but also manages student information and academic records, providing a more comprehensive solution than
traditional result computation systems.

For the frontend, I have used HTML and CSS to design the user interface. The backend is developed using Java,
connected with a MySQL database for storing and managing student records. 
I used MySQL Workbench to design and manage the database.
